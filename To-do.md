TODO:
  - Switch `BETA.Color` from a constructor function called with new,
    to be analogous with `BETA.vector`

  - Add support for image rendering, with error-checking for non-loaded images

  - Keyboard support and keyboard event system

  - Mouse pointer and button support, with related event handling

  - Test for possible bugs if `*context*.beginPath` is called but not `*context*.endPath`
