## BETA.js
A simple canvas-based JavaScript library for game prototyping and graphical experiments.

The aim of this library is to reduce the amount of boring setup code required in graphics projects,
as well as to save developers from having to interact with the DOM API,
because *I value the health and sanity of developers.*

### Visit [the Wiki](https://github.com/CookieShade/BETA.js/wiki) for documentation

**Caution:**
BETA.js requires support for several ECMAScript 5 and modern DOM features, and so will not work in older browsers.


The API aims to be:
- Simple
- Easy to learn
- Lightweight

It does not attempt to:
- Support all browsers, past, present and future
- Replace standard APIs completely
- Think for you

BETA.js is a library, not a framework.
